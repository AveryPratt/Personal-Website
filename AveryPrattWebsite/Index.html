                        Hi, I am Avery.<br /><br />

                        I am that guy who finds a difficult puzzle and then gladly spends the rest of the day in my room trying to figure it out. 
                        <em>Especially</em> if it is physics- or space-related.<br /><br />

                        I have a solid background in violin performance and composition that led me to pursue a bachelors degree in music, which I completed in June 2016 at the University of Oregon, Eugene. 
                        In the past couple of years I have come to realize that, although I have a passion for both music and technology, I would much rather be working with computers on a daily basis. 
                        Music will always be a passion and a vocation for me, but I have found that my interest in the structure, logic and beauty of music easily translates into other applications, especially computer programming.
                        After coming across a beginner's C# tutorial towards the end of 2015, I have since been steadily gaining momentum towards becoming a self-taught, full-stack developer.
                        I am looking for opportunities to further develop my skills as a software developer, which so far have been largely self-taught as I completed my music degree.

                            Rocket Calculator is a tool I developed that is used to optimize the design of and explore the capabilities of rockets. 
                            Ok, so we can all agree rockets are cool, but why would somebody want to go out of their way to design one?
                            Well, that is the exact premise of an incredibly popular simulator game, <a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/" target="_blank">Kerbal Space Program</a> (KSP).
                            KSP, as well as other similar games such as <a href="http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Orbiter</a>, allow players to to design and test rockets.
                            Once launched, the vehicle's thrust and trajectory adhere to strict Newtonian and Keplerian laws of motion, meaning you can use the same physics equations that real space agencies use to plan their missions.<br /><br />

                            That's where Rocket Calculator comes in. 
                            Many of these simulators, including Kerbal Space Program, provide the player with inadequate information about their rocket design.
                            Unless they have flown a lot of rockets before, they have no way of knowing if their engines are powerful enough to safely land on the moon, or if they have enough fuel to return.
                            Rocket Calculator provides the information necessary to ensure a safe journey, and can also be used to optimize the design to fit a specific mission profile.
                            It can also, of course, be used to calculate the characteristics of real rockets. 
                            How large of a payload could SpaceX's Falcon 9 bring to Mars?
                            Which of Jupiter's moons would the Apollo moon lander be able to touch down on?
                            Rocket Calculator can figure it out for you.<br /><br />

                            I developed KSP Library, a class library, alongside Rocket Calculator to provide myself and others an accessible framework for creating space- or astronomy-related applications in .net. 
                            KSP Library contains classes that can be used to easily perform complex calculations to solve problems related to rocketry and orbital physics.
                            Another useful function KSP Library serves is to provide useful information about each planet, moon, or star, or other celestial body in our solar system. 
                            This information can be used in many different ways, such as calculating a planet's local gravity, or comparing the mass ratio between a planet and it's moon.
                            Best of all, KSP Library even allows for a user to model their own solar system should they choose to create one.
