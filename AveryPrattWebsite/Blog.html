                        Ok, so after setting up an extra html page on my site and quickly googling "how to start a blog", I've arrived at the conclusion that like most of my endeavors in tech, I'm just gonna have to jump in and wing it. So here goes. Tomorrow is my first day of code camp. While this is super exciting for me, and I can't wait to get started, there is that little voice in the back of my head reminding me that tomorrow also marks the end of my exclusively-self-taught education. I realize that in many ways, being an educational "purist" and boasting that I am entirely self-taught makes me similar to that guy who who scoffs at people who read books on their kindle as if reading the same story off of ink and paper somehow amplifies its meaning. <em>It doesn't.</em> Nonetheless, I'm proud of the work I've done on my own, and part of my motivation for starting this blog the day before I start code camp is to commemorate everything I've accomplished on my own in the last nine months. That being said, it's about time I took an actual class. Not because of the accelerated learning, or the discipline it provides, or even the 95% job placement rate of graduates, (I have proven that I am more than able to provide the first two for myself) but because up until this point, I have been comfortable making myself completely invisible to the rest of the tech comunity. To get a job, clearly, that has to change. Unfortunately, I also happen to be the worst person in the world at networking. *So essentially, I need a coding bootcamp the same way someone bad at asking people on dates needs OK Cupid. <br /><br />

                        Of course, most of the time that I will be spending at camp (I assume) will be learning technology, and any networking/relations will be a byproduct of working with my classmates and instructors. Because of this, I decided that I might as well learn a completely different technology stack while I'm there. Up until this point, I have coded exclusively with visual studio building projects using C# .NET and SQL. Part of the reason I chose to attend Code Fellows (the name of the bootcamp) is because the curriculum starts off giving us a thourough understanding of html, css, and javascript. From there, we can choose to continue learning javascript (with a focus on server-side programming from what I understand), or we can take a class in Python or IOS development. Whichever route I choose, it's unlikely to overlap much with what I already know, so I'll be happy when it comes time to double the length of the "skills" section of my resume.<br /><br />

                        I'll try to keep this post brief seeing as I have no idea how my blog will develop over time and I'm likely embarassing my future self. As I mentioned before, I'm super excited to officially start classes tomorrow, and to add more entries to this blog for the amusement of whoever is interested in reading it.<br /><br /><br />


                        *<em>Nerdy side-note: That isn't to say that everyone who uses OK Cupid is bad at asking people on dates, just like not everyone who attends code camp does so because they need help networking.</em>
